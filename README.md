## coding-refactor


## Summary
The purpose of this assignment was to refactor a code in order for it to follow acesssibility standards.

## Steps
To refactor this code in order to meet accessibility standards, first I ensured that all possible images were given alts in order to be read by screen-readers. 

After writing the alts, I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link by adding an id.

Finally, I replaced all divs with sections in order to meet accessibility standards. I replaced them in both the html and css pages. 

After every change I ensured that the site still functioned as intended, so I would know where I made an error along the way. 

## Code Snippet
An example of the section tags that replaced div tags.
